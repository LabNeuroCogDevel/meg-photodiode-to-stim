#ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE DATA
* Stim channel changes **BEFORE** photodiode changes
* Zero values in stim channel should be overwritten with the last  
  value of the stim channel
* Distances between photodiode values on adjacent screens are much  
  larger than variation in photodiode value on a single screen
#DEFAULT VALUES
* Input stim channel is STI101
* Input photodiode channel is MISC007
* Output stim channel is STI101
* Reasonable thresholding value for the photodiode data is 0.4
